                    <h1> More about me! <br> <br> </h1>
                    <p> I'm Amir Mrabet, a dedicated and ambitious first-year software engineering student at the North
                        American School in Sfax, Tunisia. I am 26 years old and was born and raised in Sfax,
                        Tunisia.<br><br> My
                        academic journey has been great, with a strong focus on both technical and theoretical aspects
                        of computer science. I have obtained 3 diplomas since 2015/2016 when I passed my
                        baccalaureate.<br><br>
                        I studied management computing at FSEG in Sfax, where I received my bachelor's degree last year
                        with distinction. Additionally, I have two diplomas in the agricultural field, which demonstrate
                        my diverse interests and ability to excel in multiple fields.<br>
                        <br>
                        Regarding my hobbies, I am an enthusiastic selenophile, which means I am deeply passionate about
                        the moon. I am also an avid amateur astronomer, and I enjoy observing and studying the night
                        sky. I often take photos of the moon and other celestial objects through my telescope and
                        camera, which is my way to express my love for the beauty of the universe. My passion for
                        astrophotography began in 2015 when I received a DSLR camera as a gift, and since then the
                        astronomy world has been my escape and source of inspiration.<br><br>

                        I am also a passionate home cook and baker, who enjoys experimenting with different recipes and
                        ingredients in the kitchen. I have a keen interest in food photography, and I enjoy capturing
                        the beauty of my culinary creations through the lens of my camera. Furthermore, I am a nature
                        lover, who enjoys spending time in the great outdoors, hiking and observing the beauty of
                        nature.<br>
